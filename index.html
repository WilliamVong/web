    <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: Discord Bots</h2>
    <p>
      Ever since the start of COVID-19, I've been using Discord to communicate with others. And then, one day, I asked myself "How about I make one myself?"<br>
      So that day, I started working on my first Discord Bot, <strong>Thunderbot</strong>.<br>
      After that day, I have made countless Discord Bots, in 3 different packages/languages (Discord.py, Discord.js, and Eris)<br>

      <a href="https://repl.it/@WilliamVongphan/Thunderbot-Mk2-1#index.js">My second bot</a><br>
      <a href="https://repl.it/@WilliamVongphan/thunderbot-er1s#.replit">My third bot</a><br>

    <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Web Development</h2>
    <p>
        As with the discord bots above, I have taken new interests into different things since the quarantine started.<br>
        For my AP Calculus BC final project, I built a website that showed demos of many calculus theorems and proofs.<br>
        You can look at it here: <a href="https://calculusdemos-proofs.glitch.me/">Click me!</a><br>

        After some time I learned that it's not just HTML that is used to host a website, you also need a webserver and a DNS.<br>
        Since then I learned how to host my own Apache server and use Ngrok to tunnel to my Localhost!

    <h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: Food</h2>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, during this time of quarantine, we have been stuck away from the sidewalks and close to the fridge. <br>
        These days I have been interested in food and its production.
